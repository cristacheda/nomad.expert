# Contributing to My Travel Papers

Thank you for taking an interest in My Travel Papers! The project was started in 2020 and it aims to make travel information easy to use, understand and act upon - particularly documentation.

As of February 2025, the project is live in the Open Beta phase at https://mytravelpapers.com/

At the moment, the database gathers info for travels from Romania to the other countries of the world, but we are open to the idea of the project expanding. If you live in another country, you have a different nationality or you have access to credible and up to date information about travel documents and travel conditions and you wish to contribute to the data base, you can do so! Please check out the steps below.
